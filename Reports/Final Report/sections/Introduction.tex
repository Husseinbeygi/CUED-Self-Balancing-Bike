Bicycles and their stability properties have been studied ever since their inception in the late 19th century, with the topic continuing to attract interest up to this very day. A vast amount of research on bicycles has been undertaken, most notably by academics such as Whipple (1899, \cite{whipple}), Papadopoulos (1980s \cite{papadopoulos}), and Astrom (2005, \cite{astrom}). \\

For the rider-less case, the bicycle can be classed as an \textit{underactuated} system, since for this project, the bicycle is only equipped with a drive actuator to provide forward speed and an actuator placed at the handlebars to provide a \textit{steer} torque. and Underactuated, actuator at handlebar commanding steer angle...

This project aims to investigate what factors influence the stability of a bicycle, and additionally explores the modelling of the dynamics, controller design, and finally the real-world implementation. This report details the work completed and the insights gained on bicycle stability and control.
