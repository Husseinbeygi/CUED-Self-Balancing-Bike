\section{Risk Assessment}
The risk assessment completed during Michaelmas term 2018 covered all risks encountered during the development of the prototype bicycle. However, the original risk assessment did not fully take into account the risks encountered during the development of the full-scale bicycle. This is due to the fact that the idea of investigating a full-scale bicycle was only conceived during a later stage in the academic year. However, before implementing the full-scale bicycle, a further risk assessment was completed that again matched all encountered risks in the final implementation.
