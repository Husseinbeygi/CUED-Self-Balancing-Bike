For the actual real-world implementation, controller design is actually a small part of the work. Need to worry about acquiring good estimates of states, writing all the peripheral software, drivers, sizing actuators, modelling the system, estimating parameters, etc, etc. \\
A controller that works in theory actually takes quite a lot of effort to work in practice.  \\
Extremely difficult to stabilise this system, made even harder due to underactuation and difficulty in verifying model. Possibly could try adding flywheel to provide lean torque. Maybe better modelling.
