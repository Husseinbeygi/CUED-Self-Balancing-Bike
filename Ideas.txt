Inverted pendulum
Controls: rotate fork, motor speed, brakes(?)
Mounting servo directly at fork (not via gears) gives us direct access to fork rotation (assuming initial calibration)
Stationary (track stand) vs at speed (critical velocity) (static vs dynamic stability)
Robustness (varying frame geometry, added mass (potentially even rider))
non-linear equations incredibly complex (give references)
linear equations (whipple, fourth order) -> linearisation about velocity/upright position/etc.
Can we measure all states? If not, Kalman Filter (observer)
Funding -> Build full-scale model (riderless) -> Arduino? Raspberry Pi?
Controllability -> How many actuators do we need?
Observability -> What is the minimum amount (and type) of sensors needed?
Hall Effect Sensor on wheel to measure speed
At zero speed, lose controllability
2nd order vs 4th order model - linear vs nonlinear?
Simulation - only linear?
SISO vs MIMO feedback design
Gain-scheduled state feedback, since stability varies across 3 regimes (unstable, stable, nearly stable) + integral feedback (do we need this?)
PID?
Optimal control / MPC
Possible options for stabilising at zero speed? Spinning wheel?
Control at speed with rider on as well?
Disturbance rejection
Trajectory tracking -> manual control, GPS, etc.
Non-minimum phase: Handlebar torque to steer angle
