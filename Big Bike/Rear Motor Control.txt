- Brake cables:
	-> simple on/off
	-> brakes engaged if wires connected (blue & black)

- Master on/off switch:
	-> On: Connect brown and yellow

- LEDs:
	-> Leave connected
	-> LED colours: Red>EMPTY
			Yellow>HALF
			Green>FULL
	-> Green: Signal
	-> Black: Ground

- Throttle:
	-> Used to be hall-effect type (I assume)
	-> Essentially, potential divider
	-> Red: Vcc = 5V (can leave unused)
	-> Black: Ground (connect to Arduino ground)
	-> White: Signal (Speed control) between 0V and 5V
		-> Using Arduino Uno (5V outputs), connect to PWM pin
		   use analogWrite(pin, val),
		-> val triggers motor at approx 70.
		-> Motor doesn't start smoothly, therefore
		   slowly increase val until motor starts, otherwise jumpy.
